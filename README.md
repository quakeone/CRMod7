# CRx: ClanRing Xtended Mod

An updated version of the ClanRing Quake1 server mod for competitive multiplayer play.  CRx is an all-in-one mod (similar to KTX for QuakeWorld) that supports CA, CTF, TDM, FFA, and other game modes.  The mod relies on FTE extensions, so much be run on FTEsv or QSS-M binaries.

Based on the original [CRMod](https://github.com/jp-grossman/crmod), and [CRCTF](link?) code by JP Grossman.

## Changes from the original Source (TODO)

- link a diff from the CRMOD repo
- highlight key updates / differences

## Compiling the Source (TODO)

- add clear & complete compilation instructions.
  - compiler should probably not be included in the project, but clear steps on how to compile should be.

## Setting up and running a CRMod 2021 server (TODO)

- add clear & complete server setup instructions
  - how do I add custom maps / make maps votable, etc?
